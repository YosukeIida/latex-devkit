description: Install a Claude Code .skill file into the user's skills directory. Usage: /install-skill <path-to-file.skill>
---

Install a `.skill` file into the Claude Code user skills directory so it becomes available globally.

## Target directory

```
~/.claude/skills/
```

Skills placed here are picked up by Claude Code automatically.

## Steps

1. Determine the skill name from the filename (strip `.skill` extension)
2. If the file is in `~/Downloads/`, warn the user that macOS may block terminal access and ask them to move it to `~/Desktop/` or another accessible directory first
3. Create the destination directory: `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`
4. Extract using: `unzip -j <file> "*/SKILL.md" -d <dest> 2>/dev/null || unzip -j <file> "SKILL.md" -d <dest>`
   - The `-j` flag discards subdirectory paths, avoiding nested directory issues
5. Verify `SKILL.md` exists in the destination
6. Report the installed path

## Notes

- If the user doesn't provide a path, ask for it
- If `~/Downloads/` access fails with "Operation not permitted", instruct the user to move the file to `~/Desktop/` or another directory outside macOS' protected locations
- Restart Claude Code (or reload skills) for the new skill to be picked up
